As any other Linux-user, I have quite a lot of ideas to implement in code. And there's three problems I want to solve with this project:

  * to keep all the little scripts etc. in one place, accessible with Mercurial

  * to make them all easily accessible for anyone via WWW or mentioned earlier hg

  * to have my own little Gentoo [overlay](http://code.google.com/p/qmellon/source/browse?repo=overlay) with all the ebuilds I've written

So... That's all! I'll keep updating description as more files would (hopefully) appear here
